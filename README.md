## From Words to Code

Once upon a time, I made English, German and Japanese words dance into French. Now, I make applications dance in the cloud!

**The Journey:**
- **Former life:** Translator (EN/DE/JP → FR) - I was basically Google Translate's cooler older sibling
- **Main quest:** Conquering the 42 Barcelona Common Core (✅ July 2025)
- **Side quest:** Currently specialising in DevOps

## My Coding Arsenal


**Languages I speak (to computers):**
- **C/C++** - Respect your elders, they'll teach you humility one segfault at a time
- **Python** - Gotta love a language that lets you casually cast a string into an unsigned Seat Ibiza
- **Golang** - A bit trendy, a bit practical (it's like C without all the memory management headaches)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Because who doesn't love async chaos and unfulfilled promises?
- **Assembly** - The lowest level of programming before murmuring 0s and 1s to your CPU
  
**Language I'm learning:**
- **Rust** - This one feels like a cult to be honest... everyone who gets it tries to convert me, but I don't get the hype

**Additional Power-Ups:**
- **Terraform** - Build amazing things... or accidentally demolish everything
- **Docker** - Containerising everything like a digital Marie Kondo
- **Ansible** - Teaching AWS instances to behave
- **Kubernetes** - Orchestrating containers like a digital conductor
- **Helm** - Charting a course through the stormy seas of K8s (captain's orders: template everything)
- **ArgoCD** - GitOps: where your cluster trusts Git more than you do
- **Prometheus & Grafana** - Turning metrics into pretty dashboards that scream when things break

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

Always up for chatting about:
- People that remember the command to extract a tar file without googling it up first
- Why documentation is important (but who has time for that?)
- What is your favourite shell and why (Bash <3)

*Fun fact: I can debug in three languages, but please don't ask me to center a div* 🤷‍♂️
