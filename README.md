## Plot Twist: From Words to Code

Once upon a time, I made English, German and Japanese words dance into French. Now I make servers dance instead!

**The Journey:**
- 🗣️ **Former life:** Translator (EN/DE/JP → FR) - I was basically Google Translate's cooler older sibling
- 🎯 **Main quest:** Conquering the 42 Barcelona Common Core (✅ July 2025)
- 🚀 **Side quest:** Currently training in Backend, DevOps and UNIX wizardry

## My Coding Arsenal

**Languages I speak (to computers):**
- **C/C++** - Respect your elders, they'll teach you humility one segfault at a time
- **Assembly** - The lowest level of programming before murmuring 0s and 1s to your CPU
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Because who doesn't love async chaos and unfulfilled promises?
- **Python** - Currently a bit rusty but still dangerous

**Languages I'm learning:**
- **Golang** - A bit trendy, a bit practical (it's like C without all the memory management headaches) 🐹
- **Rust** - This one feels like a cult to be honest... everyone who gets it tries to convert me, but I don't get the hype 🦀
- **Terraform** - Like giving a bulldozer to a kid: you can build amazing things... or accidentally demolish everything 🚜

**Current Power-Ups:**
- 🐳 **Docker** - Containerizing everything like a digital Marie Kondo
- ⚙️ **Ansible** - Teaching AWS instances to behave
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** - Orchestrating containers like a digital conductor
- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipelines** - Because manual deployment is so 2010

## What flips my bits

- **Backend Development** - Where the real magic happens
- **DevOps** - Automating all the things!
- **Low-level Programming** - Getting down and dirty with bits and bytes
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Because clicking buttons is for peasants

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

Always up for chatting about:
- Code that actually works on the first try (mythical, I know)
- The best ways to break production (accidentally, of course)
- Why understanding what happens under the hood matters
- Why documentation is important (but who has time for that?)

*Fun fact: I can debug in three languages, but don't aske me to center a div* 🤷‍♂️
