## From Words to Code

Once upon a time, I made English, German and Japanese words dance into French. Now, I make applications dance in the cloud!

**The Journey:**
- 
 - [x] **Former life:** Translator (EN/DE/JP → FR) - I was basically Google Translate's cooler older sibling
 - [x] **Main quest:** Conquering the 42 Barcelona Common Core (✅ July 2025)
 - [ ] **Side quest:** Currently specialising in DevOps and aiming for the [RNCP 7 - IT Architecture
       Expert](https://www.credly.com/org/42/badge/rncp-niveau-7-expert-en-architecture-informatique-a.2)

**Languages I speak (to computers):**
- **C/C++** - Respect your elders, they'll teach you humility one segfault at a time
- **Python** - Gotta love a language that lets you casually cast a string into an unsigned Seat Ibiza
- **Golang** - A bit trendy, a bit practical (it's like C without all the memory management headaches)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Because who doesn't love async chaos and unfulfilled promises?
- **Assembly** - The lowest level of programming before murmuring 0s and 1s to your CPU

**Languages I speak (to humans):**	🇨🇵🇬🇧🇩🇪🇪🇸🇯🇵

**Additional Power-Ups:**
- **Terraform** - Build amazing things... or accidentally demolish everything
- **Docker** - Containerising everything like a digital Marie Kondo
- **Ansible** - Teaching AWS instances to behave
- **Kubernetes** - Orchestrating containers like a digital conductor
- **Helm** - Charting a course through the stormy seas of K8s (captain's orders: template everything)
- **ArgoCD** - GitOps: where your cluster trusts Git more than you do
- **Prometheus & Grafana** - Turning metrics into pretty dashboards that scream when things break


## Current projects
- [**Dawn Treader**](https://github.com/mrlouf/dawn-treader) - Deploying a web app onto the cloud using Kubernetes, Terraform and Ansible.
- [**Musical Sync**](https://github.com/mrlouf/musical-sync) - An application that synchronises your playlists across streaming platforms, written in Go.

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

Always up for chatting about:
- People that remember the command to extract a tar file without googling it up first
- Why documentation is important (but who has time for that?)
- What is your favourite shell and why (Bash <3)
